# Regression Analysis

## Simple Linear Regression
### Metric: Score
lm.score <- lm(
  score ~ access_complexity + access_vector + authentication +
    availability_impact + confidentiality_impact + integrity_impact,
  data = dataset
)
print(summary(lm.score))

### Metric: Amount
lm.amount <- lm(
  amount ~ access_complexity + access_vector + authentication +
    availability_impact + confidentiality_impact + integrity_impact,
  data = dataset
)
print(summary(lm.amount))

### Stepwise Selection
### Metric: Amount
lm.amount.subset <- step(lm.amount, direction = "both", k = 2)
print(summary(lm.amount.subset))

## Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees
### Metric: Score

rpart.score <- rpart(
  score ~ access_complexity + access_vector + authentication +
    availability_impact + confidentiality_impact + integrity_impact,
  data = dataset, method = "anova"
)
print(summary(rpart.score))

### Metric: Amount
rpart.amount <- rpart(
  amount ~ access_complexity + access_vector + authentication +
    availability_impact + confidentiality_impact + integrity_impact,
  data = dataset, method = "anova"
)
print(summary(rpart.amount))
